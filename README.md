# Starbound---Webbers
Adds in Webber(s) to Starbound

# WARNING: 
I am in NO WAY responsible for your saves with this modded Starbound race. If your saves get corrupted, you play with (possibly) conflicting mods, your spider friends go missing, your cat dies, your pizza doesn't get delivered, or net neutrality ends, I AM NOT LIABLE for the damages that may be associated with this mod. That being said, IF YOU EVER GET A CRASH WITH THIS MOD IN YOUR STARBOUND, send me the log and I'll determine if it's ACTUALLY my fault or you're bothering me with something not related to this mod. This mod is already large, and it's as unstable as it is huge to the power of six. 

FOR THOSE PLAYING WEBBERS LIKE THEY'RE FULLY COMPLETE AND DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANYTHING IF THIS MOD HAS A MAJOR UPDATE:

I have a few personal warnings here.

With the coloring methods the humanoid sprites have, I can not guarentee that your character will keep the old colors (black hair w/ white eyes) if the humanoid sprites ever do update. (Warning: That's very likely for a lore update.) If you want to keep the original colors in that case, then okay, don't update. You can always back up your characters at any time and store them for later use. Shouldn't this be obvious already?

Also, don't trust every single update on the GitHib repository. Like above, when I say this is unstable with the measurement of size^6, I mean it. I recommend waiting for the next stable release (In a .pak) if you aren't testing or collaborating on this.

Thank you for listening to my warnings.

# FEATURES:

- Webbers DO have FR support as of now. the sats are a bit wonky but they'll be fixed.

- Partially incomplete custom ships, but hey, Tiers 0-3 aren't the recolors again.

- MOSTLY custom shape humanoids. They have big, weirdly shaped heads and an extra pixel or two on the feet. (No seriously, they can't wear most hats)

- LORE! It's more lore-friendly for Starbound really, but ok.

- A GitHub repository. You're viewing it right now. You can freely test out stuff before it gets released, but be careful.

- Bugs. You decide the meaning of this feature.

- Custom dungeons/microdungeons/villages.

- Character customization: Yeah, it's there. Webbers do like some nice hair styles, don't they?

- Hurt soun- no. Please don't hurt these "endangered" species just to hear them cry. Don't. You'll make me cry.

- Tenants: They're still not your annoying nextdoor neighbors, so they're disapointing.

- Nyctophobia: Webbers are probably the first race to have a crippling fear of the dark. (PLAY WITH FRACKIN' RACES FOR FULL EFFECT)

- Custom S.A.I.L: Comes with Webber-specific dialogue. Also space humor.

- Weapons and clothing/armors: Still a huge WIP.

Thought I'd also need to make this statement.

PS: No log, no fix. Don't send empty bug reports unless if it is only a visual bug.
