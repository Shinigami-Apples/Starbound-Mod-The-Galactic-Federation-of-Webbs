    "^yellow;Overview^white;

    Welcome to life, newly created lifeform! You have been created by a machine called [REDACTED] on [REDACTED] [REDACTED]-[REDATED], and you may be wondering why you were created. You were created as an experiment to save a species that was doomed to extinction with only one of it's kind left. Other than that, your life is up to you.",

    "^yellow;Species Information^white;

    Webbers seemingly are humans biologically imbeded into the body of a spider. This strange occourance is unkown, but this can be reproduced in laboratory machines and bio-printers. They're both mammals and insects with a possibly in-body mutualism relationship, as observed in behavours being a mix of both creatures.",

    "Their service-service relationship allows for intelligence and tool making on the human side, with a highly efficient digestive system and the added strength of the spider.",


    "Webbers are eusocial, but they usually tend to be solitary in less civilized environments. Curiously, Webbers have a dunbar's number of 550 to 700, most likely being that they have two equally shared minds, even though the more civilized one has dominance over the body. Studies have shown that they are pacifists to each other and many other intelligent-functioning species, as all tests have failed to promote natural agressive competition for resources such as food and land.",

    "More research in their social lives had recently uncovered that they eat their own fallen, weither it be of the same species, or another. The reason why is unclear, but it's hypothesized to have been an evolutionary instinct to prevent more casualities when group populations get low and weaker.",
